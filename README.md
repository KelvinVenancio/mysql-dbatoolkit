# Madeline's MySQL DBA Toolkit
Tools, scripts, and standardized configuration files for MySQL. Things I've written to enable me to be lazier, or more productive... not sure which. 

## Installation
mysql> create database dbatools;
linux/osx/bsd> mysql dbatools < dbatools.schema/stored_procs.sql
mysql> use dbatools;
mysql> show procedure status;
mysql> "call some of the procedures... most are self explanatory by name"

## Standardized my.cnf files for mysqld
- These are ordered by RAM sizes. 

## Scripts directory
- Various files that have different purposes.
